Quick Usage Notes for ChatGPT Advanced Voice

- Activation: In the ChatGPT app (iOS/Android), tap the headphone/waveform icon in the chat to enable voice. For the best experience, ensure you're on Plus/Pro (Advanced Voice has lower latency, emotion detection, and better interruption handling in 2026).
- Customization: Swap in your actual role/company in the brackets, or leave it blank and let it ask — it will guide you conversationally.
- What the End "Report" Feels Like: ChatGPT often delivers this verbally in a natural, paced way (e.g., "Overall, 8 out of 10... Strengths: - Strong STAR structure... - Confident tone with good energy... Areas to improve: - Reduce fillers like 'um'... - Add more metrics... Tips: 1. Practice quantifying..."). You can follow up like "Repeat the summary" or "Expand on tip #2" for more.
- Tone Tweaks: If you want it tougher, add to the prompt: "Be skeptical and challenging — no hints or softening unless I ask." For more coaching-focused, say "encouraging but direct."
- Why This Works Well Here: Advanced Voice picks up on speaking speed/pauses/emotion better than text, so delivery feedback feels more insightful (e.g., "You sounded hesitant on that one — try projecting more confidence").
