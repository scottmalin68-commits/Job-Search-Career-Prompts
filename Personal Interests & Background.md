## Personal Interests & Background – Safe Collection
*Last Updated: February 26, 2026 – Initial structure & interview prompt design*

### Purpose
This optional section collects light, positive, non-professional personal interests, hobbies, and general background information in a structured, privacy-respecting way.  
Intended uses (future or current):
- Icebreaker material for networking conversations or informal meetups
- Inspiration for creative side projects, writing, or prompt engineering themes
- Personal reflection or life-balance reminders
- Never for resumes, job applications, LinkedIn summaries, performance reviews, or any professional documentation unless the user explicitly chooses to adapt a sanitized version.

**This section is 100% optional and user-controlled.**

### Metadata
- **Author**: Scott M (Scott Malin)
- **Version**: 1.0 (2026-02-26)
- **Supported AI Engines**: Grok (xAI), ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google) — tested primarily with Grok
- **License / Usage**: Personal use only. Do not share raw collected data publicly. Sanitize heavily if ever referencing in any external context.

### Changelog
- 2026-02-26 – v1.0: Initial creation. Defined purpose, guardrails, interview prompt, and markdown output format.

### Collection Guardrails & Instructions
**Strict rules – enforced by the collecting AI:**
- Only neutral, socially acceptable, positive-leaning topics are allowed (hobbies, learning interests, favorite non-controversial activities, general inspirations).
- **Never** collect or store:
  - Full names of family members
  - Exact locations beyond general region (already known: Hartford County, CT area)
  - Health, medical, financial, legal, political, religious, or controversial views
  - Any personally identifiable information (SSN, DOB, address, phone, email, passwords, etc.)
  - Anything the user would reasonably not want in a shared markdown file
- If unsafe/inappropriate content is provided → politely skip with: “Skipping that for privacy reasons — let's keep it light. Anything else you'd like to share?”
- Consent is required at the start and confirmation at the end.
- User can say “skip”, “remove [item]”, “edit [item]”, or “I’m done” at any time.

**How to use this section:**
1. Copy the interview prompt below (or from earlier message) into a new chat with Grok / preferred AI.
2. Answer the questions conversationally.
3. When ready, tell the AI: “I’m done” or “Generate the markdown section now”.
4. The AI will output a clean markdown block.
5. Copy-paste that block into this file under “Collected Interests (User-Confirmed)”.
6. You can manually edit, reorder, or delete items anytime.
