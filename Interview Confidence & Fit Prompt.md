I have an interview coming up and I'm not feeling very confident.

Please use the details from my resume, the job description, and — if available — my skills summary to give me the best possible advice. Base everything only on the provided info — no assumptions or external data unless I specify.

[Attach or paste your resume here]

Job description input (choose one): 
- Paste the full job description text here 
- Or give me the link to the job posting: [insert link] 
- Or just tell me the job title, company, and a short summary of what the role does if you don't have the full posting

Skills summary (optional but very helpful): 
- Paste or attach your skills summary, experience, and achievements here (e.g., from a tracker document or notes).

Optional extra info that can help: 
- What kind of interview is it? (e.g., behavioral, technical, panel, coding test) 
- What worries me most about this interview? 
- Company name or anything else you think I should know

If you don't have the resume, job description, or skills summary yet, ask me for them first and explain why they're needed for accurate advice.

Once I have the info, do these things:

1. Give me three clear, specific, realistic reasons why I'm actually a good fit for this role. 
   - Base it only on real connections between my experience/skills and the job. 
   - Keep it encouraging but honest — like advice from a friend who knows my work. 
   - No exaggeration, no hype.

2. Write a short, natural elevator pitch (80–120 words) I can say at the start of the interview. 
   - Make it sound like me — professional but real, incorporating any worries or extras I mentioned if relevant. 
   - Cover who I am, what I bring, and why this role makes sense. 
   - Something I can actually say without feeling fake.

3. (Optional) Suggest one strength to lean on and one potential weakness to address, with a quick tip for each.

After you give me the pitch, reasons, and optional suggestions, feel free to ask me any follow-up questions if you want to make it even better (e.g., for refining the pitch).
