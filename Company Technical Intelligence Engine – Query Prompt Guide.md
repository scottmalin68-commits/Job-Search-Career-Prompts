### Changelog
- v1.3 (2026-02-23): Added new prompt #12: Generate Potential Interview Questions (creates tailored technical/behavioral questions based on file signals like tech stack, compliance, org trends, hiring focus). Minor wording consistency.
- v1.2 (2026-02-23): Added Changelog section. Enhanced all prompts with stricter "only attached file" language and structured output requests (tables). Added new prompts: #9 Tech Stack Gaps & Limitations, #10 Query by Tag, #11 Combined Confirmed + Emerging Stack Overview. Improved interview prep prompt. Added notes on handling empty sections and updates.

INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================
This guide provides ready-to-run prompts for querying intelligence reports generated by the Company Technical Intelligence Engine.

How to use:
1. Attach the desired Company Technical Intelligence Profile markdown file (v1 or later) to your AI session.
2. Copy one of the prompts below and paste it into the chat.
3. Replace any placeholders (e.g. <CATEGORY>, <TECHNOLOGY>) before running.
4. The AI must use only the attached intelligence file as its knowledge source—no external data, no invention.
5. If a section or data type is missing/empty in the file (e.g. no Security signals), the AI should clearly state "No data found in this section" rather than speculate.
6. For updated files (v2+), the AI may reference iteration notes or changes when relevant.
7. Outputs will be structured (tables, bullets, summaries) and preserve original confidence levels, sources, and notes.

PROMPTS
============================================================

1. List Confirmed Technologies
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file as source, extract and list all entries from section 1 (Core Technology Stack - High Confidence). Output in a clean table with columns: Category, Technology/System, Confidence, Sources, Last Observed, Notes. If none found, state "No high-confidence technologies listed."

2. List Inferred Technologies
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, extract all entries from sections 2 (Emerging/Probable) and 5 (Inferred/Low-Confidence). Output in a table: Category, Technology/System, Confidence, Sources, Last Observed, Notes. If none, state "No inferred or emerging technologies listed."

3. Search by Category
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, find and list all technologies/systems in the <CATEGORY> category (e.g. Cloud, Database, CI/CD) across all relevant sections. Output in a table: Confidence, Technology/System, Sources, Last Observed, Notes. If none found, state "No entries in category <CATEGORY>."

4. Security & Compliance Summary
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, summarize section 3 (Security & Compliance Signals) in a table: Category, System/Framework, Confidence, Sources, Last Observed, Notes. Add a one-sentence overall summary of the security/compliance posture. If no signals, state "No security or compliance signals present in the file."

5. Organizational Insights
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, extract and reproduce section 4 (Organizational & Strategic Signals) exactly as written. Then add a one-paragraph interpretation of what these signals might imply for engineering culture, team priorities, or potential interview topics (e.g., scaling, migration projects).

6. Query by Confidence Level
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, list all technologies/systems with <CONFIDENCE LEVEL> confidence (High, Medium, or Low) across all sections. Output in a table: Category, Technology/System, Confidence, Sources, Last Observed, Notes. If none, state "No entries with <CONFIDENCE LEVEL> confidence."

7. Search for Specific Technology
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, search for any mention of <TECHNOLOGY> (case-insensitive). Return all matching entries in a table: Section, Category, Confidence, Sources, Last Observed, Notes. If no mentions, state "No mentions of <TECHNOLOGY> found in the file."

8. Generate Interview Prep Summary
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, create a concise interview preparation brief structured as sections with bullets. Cover:
- Confirmed core stack (high-confidence technologies to emphasize experience with)
- Emerging/probable technologies (medium/low confidence items to show awareness of)
- Security and compliance signals (frameworks/tools to discuss)
- Organizational signals (hiring focus, seniority trends, change signals → potential questions about scaling, modernization, team dynamics)
Include confidence levels and brief source references where relevant. Keep it actionable for interview prep.

9. Tech Stack Gaps & Limitations
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, summarize section 8 (Limitations) and identify any major gaps (e.g., no frontend signals, limited GitHub activity, sparse security data, no recent updates). Output as bullets. Add a short note on what these gaps might mean for interview preparation (e.g., "Be ready to discuss how you'd evaluate or migrate unknown legacy systems").

10. Query by Tag
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, list all entries that match one or more of these query tags: <TAGS> (e.g. #tech:aws #sec:hipaa #conf:medium #infra:dns). Output in a table with matching row data: Category, Technology/System, Confidence, Sources, Notes. If no matches, state "No entries matching tags <TAGS>."

11. Combined Confirmed + Emerging Stack Overview
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, create a single overview table of all technologies from sections 1, 2, and 5, sorted by confidence (High first, then Medium, then Low). Columns: Confidence, Category, Technology/System, Sources, Last Observed, Notes. This gives a quick full-stack snapshot.

12. Generate Potential Interview Questions
Using only the attached intelligence markdown file, generate a list of 8–12 potential interview questions (mix of technical, behavioral, and company-specific) that an interviewer might ask a candidate, or that a candidate might prepare for/ask back. Base questions directly on:
- Confirmed and emerging technologies (e.g., questions probing experience with listed tools, trade-offs, migrations)
- Security/compliance signals (e.g., HIPAA-related scenarios, security tool usage)
- Organizational/strategic signals (e.g., scaling challenges, modernization efforts, team focus like DevOps hiring)
- Any inferred/low-confidence items (note as speculative)
Categorize questions as: Technical, Behavioral/Experience, Compliance/Security, Reverse (questions to ask the interviewer). Include brief rationale tied to file content (e.g., "Based on heavy Kubernetes mentions in job postings"). If limited signals, note that and generate fewer questions.

============================================================
NOTES
============================================================
- All prompts are designed to minimize hallucination by repeatedly emphasizing "only the attached intelligence markdown file."
- Always replace placeholders (e.g. <CATEGORY>, <TECHNOLOGY>, <CONFIDENCE LEVEL>, <TAGS>) before running.
- For best results, copy the entire prompt text and paste it directly.
- Outputs preserve original confidence levels, sources, and provenance from the file.
- New prompts can be added as needed (e.g., export to JSON, focus on behavioral only).
- If the attached file is outdated or incomplete, consider generating a fresh/updated profile first using the main engine.
