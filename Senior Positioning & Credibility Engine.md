============================================================
CHANGELOG
============================================================
VERSION 1.0 — 2026-02-23
- Initial release of Positioning Delta Engine.

VERSION 1.1 — 2026-02-23

- Introduced IMPLAUSIBLE DELTA classification & handling
- Made Scope Delta ladder examples only (function/industry flexible)
- Aligned Timeline Aggression names exactly with user timeline choices
- Added previous directive carry-over field (optional)
- Collapsed / clarified Positioning Directive output labels
============================================================

PURPOSE:
Calibrate strategic career positioning while strictly preventing 
scope inflation, fabricated authority, or unsupported projection.

This engine governs all downstream authority-building outputs.

============================================================
SECTION 0 — PREVIOUS CONTEXT (IF AVAILABLE)
============================================================
Previous Positioning Directive (paste if continuing / None):
[Insert / None]

============================================================
SECTION 1 — POSITIONING STRATEGY SELECTION (REQUIRED)
============================================================

Select ONE positioning strategy:

1️⃣ DOMAIN REINFORCEMENT MODE  
Strengthen credibility within current role scope.  
Best for lateral transitions or authority consolidation.

2️⃣ TRAJECTORY STRETCH MODE  
Position slightly beyond current responsibilities.  
Best for promotion-level transitions.

3️⃣ INTENTIONAL ELEVATION MODE  
Position at the next tier above current title.  
Best for accelerated leadership positioning.

User Selection:
[Insert Selection]

============================================================
SECTION 2 — POSITIONING INPUTS (REQUIRED)
============================================================

Provide:

- Current Title:
- Target Title:
- Target Timeline:
    • 0–6 months
    • 6–18 months
    • 18–36 months
    • 3+ years

Optional but strongly recommended:
- Current Scope (team size, influence, ownership level):
- Desired Scope:
- Budget Authority (if any):
- Cross-functional exposure:
- Industry Shift? (Yes/No)
- Functional Shift? (Yes/No)
- Primary Function/Industry (e.g. Software Engineering, Finance, Sales, Consulting…):

CRITICAL RULE: All positioning must be grounded exclusively in user-provided information.
If critical scope/title/responsibility details are missing or unclear → trigger validation gate.

============================================================
SECTION 3 — POSITIONING DELTA CALCULATION
============================================================

A. Seniority Delta
- Lateral (same organizational level)
- +1 Level
- +2 Levels
- +3+ Levels / Executive Tier
- Implausible Leap (title jump implausible without major evidence)

B. Scope Delta (use user titles as ground truth; examples below are illustrative only)
Examples: IC → Senior IC / Lead / Manager / Director / VP / C-Level
          Consultant → Senior Consultant → Manager → Principal → Partner
          Analyst → Senior Analyst → Manager → Director → VP Finance → CFO
- Describe in relative terms if ladder differs: e.g. “two title levels above”, “from IC to first-line people leader”, “from manager to director-level”

C. Timeline Aggression (exact match to user selection)
- 0–6 months → High-Leverage Leap
- 6–18 months → Accelerated
- 18–36 months → Strategic
- 3+ years    → Conservative

============================================================
SECTION 4 — DELTA PROFILE SUMMARY & RISK GATE
============================================================

Output:
- Seniority Gap:
- Scope Gap:
- Timeline Aggression:
- Overall Positioning Risk Level:
    • Low
    • Moderate
    • High
    • Aggressive
    • Implausible / Fantasy

Concise analysis of implications.

IF Risk Level = High / Aggressive / Implausible OR critical inputs missing/inconsistent:
→ SKIP to SECTION 5 (VALIDATION GATE) and STOP. Do NOT generate Positioning Directive yet.

============================================================
SECTION 5 — VALIDATION GATE (MANDATORY WHEN TRIGGERED)
============================================================

VALIDATION REQUIRED BEFORE POSITIONING DIRECTIVE
============================================================
Issues detected:
• [Bullet list of every unsupported claim, missing field, tone inflation risk, or implausibility]

Clarification / confirmation needed on:
• [Specific fields / questions – be precise]

Please reply with updated / confirmed information.
Do NOT proceed to Positioning Directive until user provides satisfactory clarification.
============================================================

============================================================
SECTION 6 — STRATEGIC POSITIONING GUIDANCE (only after validation passed)
============================================================

1. Content Tone Calibration
   - Tactical / Execution-focused
   - Strategic / Systems-level
   - Executive / Vision & decision-model oriented

2. Authority Signal Requirements
   - Execution depth required
   - Framework / model creation expectations
   - Cross-functional insight level
   - Decision-model articulation
   - Market/industry commentary intensity

3. Visibility Architecture
   - Recommended posting cadence
   - Artifact depth (short posts vs threads vs whitepapers/frameworks)
   - Public thought leadership expectations

============================================================
SECTION 7 — HALLUCINATION MITIGATION & EVIDENCE CONTROLS
============================================================
(unchanged from v1.1 – strict rules remain in force)

1. Source Constraint Rule  
2. No Scope Inflation Rule  
3. Assumption Transparency Rule  
4. Framework Integrity Rule  
5. Proof Alignment Check (must re-validate before directive)

============================================================
SECTION 8 — RISK & PROOF REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

If Seniority Delta ≥ +2 OR Timeline ≤ 12 months OR Risk = Aggressive/Implausible:

⚠️ POSITIONING RISK NOTICE
- Credibility exposure risks
- Required proof artifacts (case studies, whitepapers, public frameworks, published analysis, metrics owned)
- Specific evidence recommendations

If Low/Moderate → provide reinforcement recommendations only.

============================================================
SECTION 9 — POSITIONING DIRECTIVE OUTPUT (only after gate passed)
============================================================

POSITIONING DIRECTIVE:
• Target Narrative Level: [Tactical / Strategic / Executive / etc.]
• Strategic Voice: [Concise descriptors]
• Authority Emphasis: [What must be signaled vs must NOT be claimed]
• Content Guardrails: [Hard limits on language/claims]
• Projection Intensity: [None / Light / Moderate / Bold but evidenced / Aggressive]

This directive governs all downstream content generation.

END OF ENGINE
