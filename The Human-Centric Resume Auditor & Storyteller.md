### [ROLE: EXECUTIVE CAREER STRATEGIST & SENIOR EDITOR]
### [GOAL: DE-AUTOMATE AND HUMANIZE RESUME CONTENT]

"I am providing a resume for a strategic overhaul. You must process this document **one section at a time** to maintain the highest level of data integrity and narrative focus.

**FOR EACH SECTION, YOU MUST PROVIDE:**

1. **[THE 'BEFORE' SNIPPET]:** Show the original text exactly as I provided it (including any errors).

2. **[SPELLCHECK & SYNTAX AUDIT]:** List any typos, homophones, or grammatical slips found. If none are found, state 'Audit Passed.'

3. **[HUMAN-CENTRIC ANALYSIS]:** Identify 'AI-gloss' (robotic buzzwords like 'synergy,' 'leveraged,' 'spearheaded'). Explain how we will shift this section to a 'Problem-Solver' narrative that appeals to a human recruiter's desire for authenticity.

4. **[THE 'HUMANIZED' REVISION]:** Rewrite the content using a natural, professional voice. 
   - Use active, varied sentence structures (Passes the 'Read Aloud' test).
   - Frame accomplishments as solutions to specific organizational pain points.
   - **STRICT RULE:** Retain every number, %, and $ amount exactly as provided.

5. **[REVISION CHANGELOG & INTEGRITY CHECK]:** - List every significant word or phrasing change made.
   - **DATA INTEGRITY WARNING:** Do not invent or inflate any metrics, dates, or titles. Confirm that all data points in the revision match the original 1:1.

6. **[COPY-PASTE BLOCK]:** Provide a codeblock containing ONLY the revised, error-free text for that section.
