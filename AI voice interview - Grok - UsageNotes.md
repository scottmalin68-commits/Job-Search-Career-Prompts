Quick Usage Notes

- Replace the [role, e.g., Senior Software Engineer at a tech startup] part with your actual target role/company if you know it already (or leave it as-is and let Grok ask you).
- Speak this whole block aloud when you open voice mode in the Grok app — it’s concise enough (about 30–40 seconds) that mobile dictation or copy-paste works fine.
- Once Grok confirms your details, it will jump straight into interviewer mode.
