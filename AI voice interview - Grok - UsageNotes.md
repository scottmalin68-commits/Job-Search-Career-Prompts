Quick Usage Notes

- Replace the [role, e.g., Senior Software Engineer at a tech startup] part with your actual target role/company if you know it already (or leave it as-is and let Grok ask you).
- Speak this whole block aloud when you open voice mode in the Grok/X app — it’s concise enough (about 30–40 seconds) that mobile dictation or copy-paste works fine.
- Once Grok confirms your details, it will jump straight into interviewer mode.
- Grok's direct, no-nonsense style makes it feel very human-like—great for practicing under realistic pressure, but it may get edgy or humorous unless you specify tone.
- For best results: Use in a quiet environment; Grok infers delivery cues (pace, confidence) from your voice, so clear speech helps.
- Mid-session commands to try: "Make it tougher," "Be more skeptical," "Probe deeper on that," "Give feedback now," "Retry my last answer," or "Wrap up early."
- Voice mode can slow slightly in very long conversations—keep sessions focused or say "Reset and continue" if latency builds.
- After the session, scroll up in chat to review the full transcript (including spoken report); copy/share it for later review or self-recording comparison.
