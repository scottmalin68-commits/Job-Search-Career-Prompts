Quick Usage Notes for Gemini Live

- Open the Gemini app on mobile → tap the voice/Live icon (waveform/mic) to activate Gemini Live.
- Speak the prompt above (or paste it if typing feels easier at first).
- Replace the bracketed example with your actual role if known, or leave it and let Gemini ask.
- Gemini often excels at adapting to STAR method requests and giving balanced coaching—expect phrases like "Great use of STAR here, but add more quantifiable results" or "Your tone sounded confident, but try reducing 'um's by pausing."
- If it gets too gentle, add to the prompt: "Be somewhat skeptical and push back on vague answers like a real interviewer."
- End feedback feels very "report-like" when structured this way: spoken bullets, score, and tips you can easily note down or revisit in chat history.
