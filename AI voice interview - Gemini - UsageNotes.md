Quick Usage Notes for Gemini Live

- Open the Gemini app on mobile → tap the voice/Live icon (waveform/mic) to activate Gemini Live.
- Speak the prompt above (or paste it if typing feels easier at first).
- Replace the bracketed example with your actual role if known, or leave it and let Gemini ask.
- Gemini often excels at adapting to STAR method requests and giving balanced coaching—expect phrases like "Great use of STAR here, but add more quantifiable results" or "Your tone sounded confident, but try reducing 'um's by pausing."
- If it gets too gentle, add to the prompt: "Be somewhat skeptical and push back on vague answers like a real interviewer."
- End feedback feels very "report-like" when structured this way: spoken bullets, score, and tips you can easily note down or revisit in chat history.
- For best results: Practice in a quiet space with a good microphone—background noise can affect how accurately Gemini picks up tone, pace, and fillers.
- Mid-session commands you can say anytime: "Make questions harder," "Give me a similar question," "Pause and summarize my answers so far," "Retry that last one," or "Switch to more coaching style."
- Sessions can sometimes forget context in very long mocks—say "Remember our setup" or restart the prompt if needed.
- After finishing, review the transcript in chat history aloud (or record your spoken answers separately) to self-critique delivery and compare against the AI feedback.
